##Introduction 
This project enables us to learn source code control using Git.

##Purpose
To have code we can use for hands on exercises.

##Conflict on Master
This section will be different on conflictbranch.

##Method
How will we resolve this conflict, since the "base" now has a conflict in it?

##No More Conflicts
We can now merge back into Master without any trouble.
